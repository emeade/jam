JAM - Jquery Admin Mobile Theme

Author: Eric J. Duran

This is a mobile theme for Drupal 7.x build on Jquery Mobile.

The reason why I decided to make this a admin theme is because of Drupal flexibility it would be impossible to know what your page is build on.
The admin section is a lot more predictable and therefor easier for me to be a generic theme around the admin interface.

Note:
This theme currently does not work with the following modules enable: contextual, toolbar. This is my initial stab at this so there's still some problems.
This theme is not consider production ready.
